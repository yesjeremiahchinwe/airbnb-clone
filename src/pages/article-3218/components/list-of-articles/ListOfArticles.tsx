          find a similar place, depending on availability at comparable pricing.
          If a similar place isn&apos;t available or you&apos;d prefer not to
          rebook, we&apos;ll give you a refund.

        <h4>How AirCover for guests works</h4>
        <p>
          AirCover for guests provides support for serious issues with your
          booking (e.g. Host cancellation within 30 days of check-in) or during
          your stay (e.g. the heat going out in winter, the listing has fewer
          bedrooms than listed, it&apos;s a different type of homeâ€”a private
          room instead of an entire home, a major advertised amenity such as a
          pool or kitchen is missing) but it doesn&apos;t include more minor
          inconveniences, like a broken toaster.
        </p>

        <p>
          Your Host is your best point of contact to reach out to if anything
          comes up. You can <Link to="#">message your Host</Link> directly from
          your inbox to let them know what&apos;s going on.
        </p>

        <p>If an issue does come up during your stay:</p>

        <ol>
          <li>Take photos or videos of the issue, if you can.</li>

          <li>
            Contact your Host within 72 hours of discovering the problem and
            describe the issue to them to see if they can resolve it.
          </li>

          <li>
            If your Host can&apos;t resolve the issue or doesn't respond at all,{" "}
            <Link to="#">contact us</Link> as soon as possible.
          </li>

          <li>
            We&apos;ll review it and if we find it&apos;s an issue that&apos;s
            supported by AirCover for guests and you&apos;d like to leave the
            place, we&apos;ll help you find a similar place to stay, depending
            on availability at comparable pricing. If a similar place isn&apos;t
            available or you&apos;d prefer not to rebook, we&apos;ll give you a
            full or partial refund.
          </li>
        </ol>
